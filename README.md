### How Does it work

The survey creator should create a survey at [create page](deepworm.xyz:8000/survey/create) or at android client(same as the surveyed). And a QR Code will be given, which contains a url to get survey data. Then the surveyed should install [survey.apk](./android-client/survey.apk) and scan the QR Code. After finishing the survey, the surveyed should click the "Submit" button and the survey result will be uploaded.

### Completed functions
